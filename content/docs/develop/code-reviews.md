# Code Reviews
## Overview
Effective code reviews provide some of the best opportunities for learning, gaining valuable feedback from peers, ensuring that quality standards are upheld throughout a project, and defects are caught as early as possible.

We recognize code reviews can be a vulnerable exercise and should be approached with care and deliberate intention. We've collected some of the best practices for projects to systematize the code review process and lay out expectations for the creator of the pull request as well as the role of the reviewer.

Also worth reading is the pairing section because some of the same lessons overlap with code reviews even if it is happening informally or at a different stage.
