# Source Control
## Overview
Source control has less to do with the VCS system you use, and more to do with the stages code goes through on the journey from inside a developer's head, tested and merged into the main line, deployed to production, and thence in time to being identified as that accursed legacy system that is causing all the problems.

Most of our projects will use Git as their VCS, and usually with GitHub as the host for their repositories, but this is not a hard and fast rule (clients will often host their own repositories in their own system).
