# Information Security and Federal Compliance
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was passed in 2002 and made a requirement for federal agencies to impliment cybersecurity programs to protect systems and information. FISMA requires federal agencies to create and embed IT security plans, including policies for the IT risk assessment. Fisma applies to federal informationsystems and networks but also information assets that are processed or managed by government contractors, and subcontractors too. FISMA promotes taking a risk-based approach to protecting information security across federal networks. This way cyber security protection scales along with the tisk of harm resulting from a potential breach.

A risk-based approach provides an insight into the best investment in time and resources. In practice, FISMA sets out a series or requirements which includes meeting specifics NIST standards around cyber security policy and procedure. FISMA was amended and modernized 2014 with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. Often referred to as FISMA 2014, the amendments reformed the way compliance is reported amongst other changes. This guide explores the background of FISMA, what it means for federal cybersecurity, and ways to maintain and achieve compliance.
